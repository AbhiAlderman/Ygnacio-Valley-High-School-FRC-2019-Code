The files not within a folder are the most important.

OI.java - Create the controllers, buttons, and assign commands to buttons.

Robot.java - Runs through the states of the game, executing code throughout.

RobotMap.java - Creates the motors, solenoids, drivetrain, and cameras to be used in other files.

Main.java - Not created or edited by me. Given and used by FRC when creating a robotics project.

The folders are organized as follows:

SUBSYSTEMS - All files within this folder represent subsystems present on the robot. They create the methods used to control the robot, which are then utilized by the commands

COMMANDS - All files within this folder represent an action that can be controlled. These commands are controlled by the buttons in OI.java

---BACKGROUND---

This was my second ever programming project, and my first project ever using Java.

This project was created during my Junior year of high school in the 6-8 weeks provided.

This robot made it to the Semi-finals of our local tournament, which consisted of over 60 other teams.

Here is an instagram post of the robot: https://www.instagram.com/p/BvW8NmXlTiA/

---FIRST ROBOTICS COMPETITION(FRC)---

The FIRST Robotics competition is a competition in which high school teams across the globe compete by building a robot in 6 weeks to perform in each years game. The students design, build, and program their own robots as a team, and compete against other high schools in their region. The top teams from each region compete at the international finals held in Houston, Texas.
